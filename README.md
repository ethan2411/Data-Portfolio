# Data-Portfolio
This is a repository of my personal data projects!

**SQL Folder Contents:**
  - Covid Data Exploration:
      - Performed data analysis on Covid-19 data from two datasets (CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations).
      - Joined the two datasets to show the relationship between population, vaccinations, and deaths.
      - Created several views and queries to analyze Covid-19 data, including identifying countries with the highest infection and death rates.
      - Utilized techniques such as calculating percentages and cumulative sums, and employed Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables in the data analysis.
  - Housing Data Cleaning:
      - Developed SQL queries to identify and update missing property address data in a Nashville Housing dataset using COALESCE, SUBSTRING_INDEX, and LOCATE functions.
      - Separated property and owner address data into individual columns using ALTER TABLE, UPDATE, and TRIM functions to enable easier analysis of the dataset.
      - Updated inconsistent data values in the SoldAsVacant column using CASE and UPDATE functions to ensure data consistency.
      - Identified and deleted duplicate records using common table expressions (CTEs) and the DELETE function, improving data accuracy and reliability.
      - Utilized SQL queries to drop unused columns from the dataset using ALTER TABLE, improving database performance and storage efficiency.
