## Python Projects:
  ### [K-Means Clustering for an Optimal Portfolio](https://github.com/ethan2411/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/K-Means/K-Means%20for%20Stock%20Portfolio.ipynb):
      - Conducted in-depth analysis of historical S&P 500 stock data, precisely quantifying annual returns and volatility.
      - Leveraged K-Means clustering to create well-defined stock clusters, driven by returns and volatility patterns.
      - Employed advanced methodologies, including Z-score for outlier detection and the Elbow and Silhouette methods for optimal cluster selection.
      - Optimized portfolio diversification with a meticulous selection of one stock from each strategically derived cluster.
      - Showcased advanced proficiency in Python (pandas, scikit-learn), expertly utilized for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, elevating data-driven decision-making capabilities.
      
## SQL Projects:
  ### [Covid Data Exploration](https://github.com/ethan2411/Data-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/Covid%20Data%20Exploration):
      - Performed data analysis on Covid-19 data from two datasets (CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations).
      - Joined the two datasets to show the relationship between population, vaccinations, and deaths.
      - Created several views and queries to analyze Covid-19 data, including identifying countries with the highest infection and death rates.
      - Utilized techniques such as calculating percentages and cumulative sums, and employed Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables in the data analysis.
      - Used Tableau to create a visual dashboard incorporating the insights gained from the SQL queries.
      - Developed interactive visualizations in Tableau to provide a comprehensive overview of Covid-19 data, including trend analysis, and geographical distributions across different countries.
      
  ### [Housing Data Cleaning](https://github.com/ethan2411/Data-Portfolio/tree/main/SQL/Housing%20Data%20Cleaning):
